Github Pull Request reordering
===============

This firefox extension reorders the Github Pull Request file diff view to display the spec files below the actual code file. 
While doing code reviews I found it helpfull to have a look at the code and test file at the same time. But depending on the size of the PR finding the corresponding spec file can be annoying. 
To make this easier this little extension reorders the view. You find the spec files directly after the code file. 

Installation
--------------

The extension is currently not published. So you need to install the extension manually:
* Download the .xpi file
* Open Firefox and go to Tools > Add-ons
* Open the menue on the top right (next to the search bar) and select "Install Add-on From File"
* select the downloaded .xpi file
* maybe restart your firefox and done.

ToDos
--------------

* currently it only supports _spec files. We should also support _test files
* make a Chrome extension



* Use it at your own risk - I have no idea what I am doing: ![gif](http://im.ezgif.com/tmp/gif_100x67_d59a40.gif)
